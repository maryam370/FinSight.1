# Test Driven Development Approach

## Testing Strategy
1. Write failing test first
2. Implement minimal code to pass test
3. Refactor code
4. Repeat

## Test Categories
### Unit Tests
- Service layer testing
- Utility function testing
- Fraud detection algorithm testing

### Integration Tests
- Database operations
- API endpoint testing
- External service integration

### End-to-End Tests
- Complete user workflows
- Transaction lifecycle
- Fraud alert scenarios

## Test Coverage Goals
- Line coverage: > 85%
- Branch coverage: > 80%
- Method coverage: > 90%
